# Official Docker MCP Registry

Welcome to the Official Docker MCP (Model Context Protocol) Registry! This repository serves as a curated catalog of MCP servers that can be easily discovered, deployed, and integrated with Docker environments. Entries in this catalog will be available at [MCP catalog][https://hub.docker.com/mcp], in [Docker Desktop's MCP Toolkit][https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/], and (for MCP servers images built by Docker) in `mcp` namespace in [Docker Hub][https://hub.docker.com/u/mcp].

## What is MCP?
The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open standard that enables AI assistants to securely connect with external data sources and tools. MCP servers provide specific capabilities and integrations that extend AI assistant functionality. Read more at [MCP Official Documantation][https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction].
